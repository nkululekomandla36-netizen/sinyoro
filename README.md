## 📱 About Sinyoro

Sinyoro is a mobile trading application designed specifically for rural communities in Africa. We understand that reliable internet connectivity is not always available in rural areas, which is why Sinyoro works completely offline, allowing users to buy, sell, and trade essential goods without requiring an internet connection.

### 🎯 Mission

To bridge the digital divide and empower rural African communities by providing them with accessible digital tools for economic participation, regardless of connectivity challenges.
